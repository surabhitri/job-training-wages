# job-training-wages
## Introduction
In the 1970s, researchers in the United States ran several randomized experiments intended to evaluate public policy programs. One of the most famous experiments is the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, in which researchers wanted to assess whether or not job training for disadvantaged workers had an effect on their wages. Eligible workers were randomly assigned either to receive job training or not to receive job training. Candidates eligible for the NSW were randomized into the program between March 1975 and July 1977.

We analyze a subset of the data from the NSW Demonstration containing only male participants. These and other data were originally analyzed in a highly influential paper by the economist Robert Lalonde. Two relevant references for the study are:

Lalonde, R. J. (1986), Evaluating the econometric evaluations of training programs with experimental data, The American Economic Review, 76, 604 - 620. (Main reference.)
Dehejia, R., and Wahba, S. (1999), Causal Effects in Nonexperimental Studies: Reevaluating the Evaluation of Training Programs, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 94, 1053-1062. (Secondary reference which analyzes a subset of the Lalonde data.)
Although the original data is based on a randomized experiment (which means we would have been able to make causal statements directly), the data provided for this project only compares a subset of the data. In the data provided, the treatment group (those who received the training) includes male participants within Lalondeâ€™s NSW data for which 1974 earnings can be obtained, and the control group (those who did not receive the training) includes all the unemployed males in 1976 whose income in 1975 was below the poverty level. This control group is based on a matched Current Population Survey - Social Security Administration file.


Questions

Part I: Is there evidence that workers who receive job training tend to earn higher wages than workers who do not receive job training?
Quantify the effect of the treatment, that is, receiving job training, on real annual earnings.
What is a likely range for the effect of training?
Is there any evidence that the effects differ by demographic groups?
Are there other interesting associations with wages that are worth mentioning?
Part II: Is there evidence that workers who receive job training tend to be more likely to have positive (non-zero) wages than workers who do not receive job training?
Quantify the effect of the treatment, that is, receiving job training, on the odds of having non-zero wages.
What is a likely range for the effect of training?
Is there any evidence that the effects differ by demographic groups?
Are there other interesting associations with positive wages that are worth mentioning?
